# State of CI in October 2023

This document aims to layout the current structure of CI, and the reasons for making it so.

# Contents

- [Mage Files](#mage)
- [Tests](#tests)

# Mage

Magefiles (https://magefile.org/) are used for all developer actions in the repo, replacing make. This, it was thought, would improve readability of our developer scripts, and add lots of debugging support. It also allows for multiple files to help seperate concerns, as well as developers to get armada running with one command and test it `mage localdev minimal testsuite` which has been very useful for making sure the developer experience and CI do not diverge.

# Tests

The test cycle of Armada is controlled through `.github/workflows/test.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

# Test Cache

We cache two locations, and only save the intergration test cache. Those locations are:
- /home/runner/.cache/go-build
- /home/runner/go/pkg/mod

This creates a cache of 1GB. Until we reduce this size, I think caching this way makes sense.

This also means there should always be a cache avaiable for new branches, and the cache will be updated on master. (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache)


# Required Jobs

This script is a virtual job in `.github/workflows/check-required.yml`. This is done because of how skipped checks are done in Github Actions, leading the behavior we do not want. This is also the system used in https://github.com/G-Research/fasttrackml and https://github.com/G-Research/ParquetSharp/blob/master/.github/workflows/check-required.yml


# Possible Improvements

## Making the long running tests fail fast

The longest running jobs are failures. For the purposes of the testsuite, they should be shortend. This could save a minute
